# Codebot Cloud Client

Codebot Cloud Client or C3 for short is a free open source Linux desktop client providing access and management of S3 compatible cloud storage services from providers such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Wasabi, IBM, Digital Ocean, and more.

Yes, S3 is now a REST API standard used by many cloud storage service providers. You can even host your own S3 service with software like MinIO.

But would you believe there doesn't exist a Linux desktop client to work with S3? Why get stuck using the command line to explore and manage your S3 accounts and their content? Well thank goodness for C3 because now there is such a client.

Finally, with regards to file mounting systems such as s3fs (S3 FUSE), they really aren't a good fit for S3 as they omit many features of S3. Some of these features edding metadata like acls and tagging, configuring CORS settings, enabling object versioning, bucket creation deletion, altering object and bucket storage classes, and many other S3 features.
